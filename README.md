# Game Instructions

<p>This section will help you getting used use with the game.<br>
You will learn the rules and the options you can choose for your game</p>
<br>

## How to play

<p>Once you have chosen the level and you click "Start" button, the game starts.<br>Your goal now is to make the maximum point. To do so, click on the circle printed on the screen at the right time.
<br>Some things are made to help you, depending on the level you choose. Apparition circles will tell you where the next circle will be, so will the apparition lines. The radius of the circle is'nt the same for each level. The harder you play, the smaller they are.</p><br>

## Levels

| Level/Features | Circles size | Apparition Lines | Apparition Circles | Split Game in two | Top Score |
| -------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | --------- |
| Easy           | Big          | ON               | ON                 | OFF               | OFF       |
| Intermediate   | Medium       | ON               | ON                 | OFF               | OFF       |
| Hard           | Small        | OFF              | ON                 | OFF               | ON        |
| Nightmare      | Tiny         | OFF              | OFF                | ON                | ON        |
| Custom         | You choose   | You choose       | You choose         | You choose        | OFF       |

<p>&nbsp</p>

## End of game

<p>There is two ways to end the game : The timer reaches 0, or you have less than 25% accuracy after 20 circles appeared.
<br></p>

### End of the timer

<p>In that case, you reached the end of the game. Well played !
<br>You will see your score on the screen and if it's high enough, it might be the top score !</p>

### Too low accuracy

<p>You lost the game. Your score will be 0 and the shame will fall on you.</p><br>
